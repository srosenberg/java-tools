Manifest-Version: 1.0
Premain-Class: org.foobar.java.tools.SimpleProf
SR1: ensures profiler's classes are loaded once; e.g., scala runtime installs its own classloader which would otherwise attempt to load some classes again...
SR2: how can we parameterize class and jar name?
Boot-Class-Path: java-tools-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-common-assembly.jar
